        Physical fitness is a state of <strong>health and well-being</strong> 🧠
        and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports,
        occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved
        through proper nutrition , moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and
        sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan. <br />
        <br />
        Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to
        carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy.
        However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is
        now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently
        and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist
        hypokinetic diseases, improve immune system and to meet emergency
        situations.
